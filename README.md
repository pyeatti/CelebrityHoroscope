# Movie Actor Horoscope

## Project Description

With this app we are creating an input field for the user to search the name of their favorite actor. Upon searching for their favorite actor the app will provide general information about them (birthdate, where they were born, movies they've been in), as well as their zodiac sign and a horoscope based on when they were born.

## User Story
